        <p>The <b>Black ethnic group</b> refers to people of African origin who share <u>cultural, historical, and genetic ties</u> to the African continent. In Brazil, this population has had a strong presence since colonial times, when <i>millions</i> of Africans were forcibly brought to work as enslaved laborers. Despite the cruelty of this process, Black people resisted and made a profound contribution to the development of Brazilian identity, <b>especially in music, cuisine, religion, and language.</b></p>

        <p>Black culture is <b>rich and diverse</b>, reflecting the many ethnic groups and nations of origin within Africa. In <u>Brazil</u>, this heritage is seen in cultural expressions like <i>samba, candomblé, capoeira, maracatu,</i> and many others that are now part of the national identity. African influence is also present in the way people <b>speak, their customs, and traditional foods</b> such as acarajé, feijoada, and other dishes rooted in African traditions.</p>

        <p>Despite their <i>cultural and historical</i> importance, <b>Black communities</b> still face social challenges like <u>structural racism, economic inequality, and violence.</u> That’s why it's essential to recognize the value of the Black ethnic group, fight prejudice, and promote <b>inclusion and appreciation of diversity.</b> Celebrating Black culture and fighting for equity is not only a matter of justice, but also of honoring the <u>rich history and cultural</u> wealth that shape Brazil.</p>

        <p><i>Black leaders, artists, and thinkers</i> have played key roles in shaping not only Brazilian society, but <b>global culture</b> as well. Figures such as <u>Zumbi dos Palmares</u>, a symbol of Black resistance in Brazil, and international icons like <b>Martin Luther King Jr.</b>, Nelson Mandela, and Maya Angelou have inspired generations through their fight for justice, equality, and human rights. Their legacy continues to influence movements that promote racial equality and social awareness.</p>
